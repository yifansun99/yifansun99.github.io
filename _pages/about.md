<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I earned my dual master degree from Tsinghua University and Columbia University, and my bachelor from Fudan University.

I‚Äôve previously worked on **Data-centric ML** and **Trustworthy ML**, with a particular focus on **Large Language Models**, and I‚Äôm always interested in exploring new and exciting machine learning topics. I value research that is, at the very least, empirically useful; ideally, grounded in theory; and, at best, elegant.

> üöÄ I am actively seeking a Research Scientist internship position for Summer 2025. Feel free to reach out if you believe there‚Äôs a potential fit.
